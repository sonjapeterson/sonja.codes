title: About Me
---

  I'm a full stack software engineer based in the Boston, MA area. Currently, I'm a senior software engineer at the nonprofit [ActBlue](https://secure.actblue.com/), where I help build fundraising tools for Democratic Party campaigns, progressive organizations, and other nonprofits. 
  
  Before joining ActBlue, I was a senior software engineer at [Devoted Health](https://www.devotedhealth.com), and a software engineer and tech lead at [BookBub](https://www.bookbub.com/welcome).

  I enjoy programming in Ruby, Golang, Javascript and Typescript. When I'm not programming, you can find me looking for new places to hike and ski around New England.
