title: About Me
---

  I'm a full stack software engineer based in the Boston, MA area. Currently, I'm a senior full stack engineer at [Devoted Health](https://www.devoted.com/), where we're working to make health care for seniors
  more compassionate and well-coordinated. 
  
  Before joining Devoted, I was a software engineer and tech lead at [BookBub](https://www.bookbub.com/welcome), building tech to help readers discover new books and help authors and publishers find audiences. 

  I enjoy programming in Ruby, Golang, Javascript and Typescript. When I'm not programming, you can find me looking for new places to hike and ski around New England.
