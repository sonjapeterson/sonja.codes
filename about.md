Hi! I'm Sonja, a software engineer living in Boston. I currently spend most of my time on back end web development and am a big fan of Ruby, but I also enjoy toying with other languages. When I'm not programming, you can find me skiing, reading science fiction, baking banana bread, and listening to Taylor Swift. When I am programming, I'm probably also listening to Taylor Swift.
